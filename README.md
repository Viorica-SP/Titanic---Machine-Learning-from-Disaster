# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

In this demo, we will explore the renowned Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition. This competition serves as an introduction to the principles of machine learning for students and involves a straightforward objective: utilizing machine learning to develop a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Besides testing multiple algorithms, we will also analyze data, visualize it, transform it, and assess the models.
